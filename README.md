# sirius
Sirius is a standalone Slack extension runner written in Go. It enables you to write and run simple extensions that can read and alter your outgoing messages in realtime.

For example, the `thumbs_up` extension automatically swaps all ocurrences of `(y)` in your messages to `üëç` (thumbs up emojii).

## How does it work?
Sirius connects to the Slack RTM API using your Slack OAuth token. Once logged in, it parses your messages and feeds them to the extensions you have enabled. Extensions modify the contents of your messages by broadcasting message edits via the RTM API.

## Wait, does this mean that Sirius can read all my messages?
Yes. Any message sent or received by your Slack account while Sirius is running will be intercepted via the RTM API and processed by the enabled extensions. However, Sirius does not store any messages or message metadata, and does not collect any message content in its logs. Messages are only kept in memory while the extensions are actively executing.

## Creating a new extension
Creating a new extension is only a matter of implementing the `Extension` interface:
```go
type Extension interface {
	Run(Message) (error, MessageAction)
}
```

The `Run` function is called with every outgoing message captured via the RTM API, and should return either an `error` or a `MessageAction`.

`MessageAction`s are returned by extensions to describe changes that should be made to the processed message. This includes things such as editing the message text or deleting it entirely. These changes are accumulated by the extension runner and are broadcasted via the RTM API in timed batches.

Extensions that do not need to modify the message in any way can simply `return NoAction()`.

An extension has exactly **200 ms** to finish execution if it wishes to provide a `MessageAction` other than the `EmptyAction` (as returned by `NoAction()`). An extension executing beyond this point will be allowed to finish, but any message actions it returns will never be applied or broadcasted.

### MessageActions
Modifications to the message text are easily described using `TextEditAction`.
```go
func (tu *HelloWorld) Run(m Message) (error, MessageAction) {
	edit := TextEdit()
	
	edit.Substitute("(y)", ":+1:")
	edit.Substitute("(Y)", ":+1:")

	return nil, edit
}
```
